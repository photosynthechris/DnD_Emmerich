# Tag Guidance for Articles
*Standard for tagging articles to reduce noise in tag cloud and clarifying tag structure*
___
The tags should encode meta properties that are not easily encoded in the directory structure for the project. Additionally, they should encode the type of article, and the location hierarchy of the article in the world (if applicable). For characters, it will also include organizational hierarchies (if applicable).

Objects (and locations, if applicable) will tag basic concepts that are essential to the object's construction. For example, this could include what kind of energy the object is made from, what alignment if follows, what kind of magic/physical/spiritual energy it embodies, etc.

Concepts will follow in a hierarchy of thought going from very general categories to very explicit. This will substitute the Wikipedia structure, where basic concepts like "political ideologies" could be a Wikipedia article, but we don't want to recreate those basic articles here.

## Basic Article Types
___
 - Meta: articles, like this one, that discuss the setting as a whole outside of the setting's concept, same with campaigns, same with obsidian management.
 - Organization: This denotes a social organization within the world itself.
 - Object: this denotes a solid construction of any kind in any location. Generally, natural structures are not considered objects, instead following under the category of "locations". Objects generally refer typically to mobile items, as opposed to constructions that are bound to larger natural bodies, like a house built on a hill.
 - Location: This denotes any natural structure or subdivision of a natural structure, that would generally be considered in human terms to be a "location".
 - Entity: Any focus in the setting that has individual will can be considered an entity. In many cases, entities are tied to some solid form, like a character, an object, like a soul bound to a book, or even a location, like the avatar of the universe.
 - Construct: this denotes a solid construction of any kind in any location. Generally, natural structures are not considered constructs, instead following under the category of "locations". Constructs generally refer to stationary items built into or onto natural or artificial objects/constructions, as opposed to mobile, independent items.
 - Concept: this denotes abstract concepts that don't have a solid form, rather primarily being concieved of in character's minds. This generally refers to man-made ideas, however the larger metaphysical concepts of the universe and multiverse also fall under this category, as they can only be perceived to the players as abstract ideas.
 - Event: Events refers to any moment in time during or before any campaign. This can also include time periods, like centuries and eras.
