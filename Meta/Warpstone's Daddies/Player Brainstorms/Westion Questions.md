I was just wanting to brainstorm some stuff like how did I get into the cult was it by accident? Or was it by choice? How did I become a hexblade? Did the cult have a cursed weapon which gave me my powers? Does the powers slowly take over me the stronger I get (like a venom type thing where we get a glimpse of another person talking)?

As a player, more about the cult that Westen is in, and how you got into that cult.

So going backwards:

Poogey comes from somewhere in Emmerich

- Used to have a wife, part of why it's hard for Tali to seduce him
	- Lost her in some tragic accident
	- He was drinking his problems away with super booze

Losing the wife led Poogey down the long path of search and discovery to find the secrets at the heart of life, to bring his wife back. That path leads him across the continent, seeking whispers and shadows of the dark arts and following them where they led. Eventually, this led him to the great arcanist and wizard master [[Zerradok]]. Zerradok taught Poogey the start of the dark arts, and introduced him into the cult with the promise that he'd learn the "truth of life and death."

After a year of dedicated study and isolation, he has little hope he'll ever bring back his wife. But he knows the cult is hiding many secrets from him, and he's determined to figure out what those are. 

Cult:
Name: [[Cult of Abaddon]]

Poogey witnesses odd communications involving Zerradok, confronts.

Initially Zerradok is angry, but, sensing opprotunity, tells Poogey the cult is part of a larger network of groups serving the mysterious "Entity of the West", who it has been said was sent from the Astral Plane to break the cycle of suffering on Tor.

Zerradok admits he does specialized research for the cult, developing gollum constructions for use in a great construction elsewhere, and researching concepts related to the medium of the planes. He does not know who he takes orders from, but tells Poogey his superiors are interested in utilizing Poogey's dedication and talent for a greater cause.

This is where Poogey recieves the message about the gathering storm.
