Thinking we're gonna continue with some trippiness and chaos, and allow the party members to go into a pocket blood witch realm where they'll fight the boss. If they're astute they'll find the computer linkup that calibrated their magic setup, and may even figure out about HAL, though only vaguely.

As for the book (rodmon, wizard of the 7 cities, protector of the continent, hero of the 5th age)...

- He is only vaguely aware that he is a book and not, in fact, a person. Explaining this to him fades from his memory extremely quickly, though other newly formed memories do not seem to.
- He seems to remember a very heroic accounting of what he did in his life (almost as if he's just )

Notes for next time:

Minor consequences leaving town, I may even pop the players ahead so we can get the game moving.

The players will be coming to the northern entrance to the under dark in the [[Grouschold Range]]. I'm thinking this will be a special settlement, with a bit of above ground development and a lot of caverns. It'll be a long left to right map using a custom map size in RimWorld and include a road going left to right into a mountain on the western edge. I should be able to put down the mountain using dev tools, if I can put down water as well I will.

There should also be a road heading further south.

I should also have maps prepared for the [[Kuunsterkollektiv]] and the [[City of Eilistrae]] just in case the players decide to run along to one of those locations. It may even be wise to put together both, and let the gate settlement be fairly small. I'd also want to put together and cave encounter and a highway encounter map.

I'll also need to figure out some NPC templates, it'll be much easier for me if I can build an NPC from a template especially if they're not "on camera" much. Named NPCs will be more obvious. Then PC's need to be refined, if I can I should get their equipment loadout and psycasting set up so they match their game PCs. Saving those to slots will help a ton.

We'll just put all skills for all characters at maximum, and put them on neutral backgrounds. Background shouldn't really effect anything displayed so I don't think that's important. Everything that's displayed can be effected in the character creator.

We'll need to make gene templates too for the different races. Certain monsters will need to be gene templates too, mainly the humanoid ones.
