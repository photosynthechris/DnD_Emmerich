Thinking we're gonna continue with some trippiness and chaos, and allow the party members to go into a pocket blood witch realm where they'll fight the boss. If they're astute they'll find the computer linkup that calibrated their magic setup, and may even figure out about HAL, though only vaguely.

As for the book (rodmon, wizard of the 7 cities, protector of the continent, hero of the 5th age)...

- He is only vaguely aware that he is a book and not, in fact, a person. Explaining this to him fades from his memory extremely quickly, though other newly formed memories do not seem to.
- He seems to remember a very heroic accounting of what he did in his life (almost as if he's just )
