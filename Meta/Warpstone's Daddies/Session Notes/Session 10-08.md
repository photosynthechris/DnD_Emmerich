# Session: 2022-10-08
___

Pre notes:

Two paths:

Can attempt to make your way west through the swamps, avoiding the [[Ihe]].

If you do this, you'll need to navigate through wildlife encounters, slaver encounters, and a witch village.

If you follow the Ihe, you'll find yourself at the village of [[Brotsnart]]

Brotsnart is a small village of maybe 100 people, surrounded by farms cutting into the swamp, focused around a tall church. Along it's exit of the Ihe, there is a tavern and inn without a name.

Town is mostly human, and slightly suspicious of other races beyond dwarves and hobbits.

Everyone in town has lost spirit, felt very fatigued as of late. Much lifestock has disappeared and crops are dying, and a mysterious blight is spreading through some of the forest.

In it notes:

Poogey walks away
