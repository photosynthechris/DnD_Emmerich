The party is jumping from the tower...

Kelda: 11
Essek: 14
Tali (doesn't like water): 16

Poogey 12 investigation
Kelda 22 perception
Tali 12 perception

Essek finds some potions, +3 armor, and air force pin

Kuo-toa Whip: 65 - 11 - 9 = 45

Whip leads the party to the fish camp, settled in the ancient ruins of Chicago

Kuo-toa altar is sat in front

Party escapes from bunker box

Essek causes a civil war between fish people that believe in the fake image of Bilbdoolpoolp and those that don't

Essek puts on pirate hat that makes him look 30 years older, but cannot remove it (hasn't discovered that yet)

Also gets an eyepatch with this spell:
The item is cursed, and attuning to it extends this curse to you. You cannot remove the item unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while cursed, you experience a rush of euphoria that leaves you incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

Find a mimic, make it drown, it tries to escape

Short rest before they explore the rest of the ship. Dungeon crawl for next time.
