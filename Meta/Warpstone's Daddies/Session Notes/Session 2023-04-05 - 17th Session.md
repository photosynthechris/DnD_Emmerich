What Grogg Did While Mommy-Daddy Was Away

Notes about the Fey-Wild:
- Also known as:
	- Ares (By most Elves)
	- Areopolis (By the High Elves)
	- Palengenia (Used primarily by Fey souls)
	- Menyalios (By the Eladrin and Fey Eladrin)
	- Mars (By the residents of the Feydark)
	- Folly (By the residents of the feydark and the radiated areas)
- Terraformed Mars, Composed of a northern sea and southern continent
- The world was devastated in an event known as "The Storm of Demons" or "The War Between Heaven and Hell", or the "Liberation War" by the Feydark factions. This was a war between the elves of Mars and the demons of Venus over ideology and overall control of the inner solar system, specifically the shattered remains of Earth.
	- Many cycles ago, Earth had finally recovered from the first apocalypse to levels of technology not seen even before the first arrival of the entity. Human civilization reached out across the solar system and established colonies and stations around almost every livable body in the system. Many of these were also self-sustaining, a kind of back-up measure if the slumbering entity even emerged again. The crown jewels of the system were the Martian and Venusian colonies, which grew to powerful sister worlds in their own right. A thousand years of prosperity and relative peace reigned, while genetic engineering and natural evolution slowly divided the human race into distinct species specialized for the various semi-terraformed environments. The entity soon reemerged, and wiped out civilization on Earth though not before great resources of the entire system were spent on trying to stop it. With Earth devastated, and Mars and Venus exhausted, many centuries passed while each society regrouped and rebuilt. Tensions which had already built up between Mars and Venus grew as contact became more difficult, interplanetary travel all but stopped, and leadership from Earth evaporated completely. These tensions culminated in a war over Earth, which at that point was starting to forget it's past once again. Once again, much of the resources in the system were spent on fighting and once again devastation spread over all worlds. Peace was eventually achieved through careful negotiations between each primary member 'world' in the system, which enforced travel agreements and limitations, and limitations on jurisdiction, specifically sectioning Earth off to find it's own way. The member worlds became inward focused and eventually stopped most contact and trade with the other worlds, and that's where the interplanetary status quo has been since. In the thousands of years that have passed, most interplanetary travel technology has been lost, only held by the highest remaining elite on each world and by dedicated arcanists studying portal and space travel. Earth has all but forgotten it's star faring past, but the member worlds have various degrees of rememberance.
- The Feywilds today is extremely decentralized, in large part thanks to the robustness of it's terraforming and the sustainability of it's climate protection system. Nominally, the various races of elves serve as the world's guardians and protectors, but pay little attention to the day to day affairs of most of the world's surface, instead tracking their sister worlds and mysterious activity on the very edges of the system. Gnomes serve the elvish elite, helping maintain the climate control systems that keep the world green. Much of the rest of the world is filled with diverse small settlements of Fey, Elves, and Gnomes.

Grogg is in the rave
Is distracted by pointy albino elf, turns out to be a rabbit man
Tells Grogg that they can help him find his "Mommy-Daddy"
Grogg is confused exactly how he leaves the cave, he remembers lots of swirly lights and the crashing of waves. He also mentions something about sweet drinks and smelly smoke
Finds himself on the
