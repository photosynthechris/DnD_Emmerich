Plans:

So up coming, the party will be looking to extract Kadek Warpstone from prison. They have hired the dragonborne bartender traitor to do this job, but I'm anticipating a backfire. The party may be able to support this effort, as a botched prison break in the midst of the peak of the drow rave is bound to cause endless chaos.

When they successfully do acquire Kadek, he will be in a very incoherent, deranged state and mostly will be speaking fractured dwarvish. He will also be very skinny and wasted away from his time in jail.

He was jailed for trying to steal records from the Drow's religious archives in the temple. The archives he was searching for are historical/mythical records of past incursions of the entity of the west, records of historical/mythical variations of the atomic bomb (called splitting fireball, arcanic fireball, and "the blast") and related accounts of radiation sickness ("melting plague", or "dissolving disease")

Kadek's goal is to create a new energy source that would empower the ancient city buried under the Kunstlerkollectiv and allow them use of the ancient arcana hiding within, including mobile weapons that could be used to take over and stabilize the region for their own bidding. That's the movement Bulla is a part of and wants the party to support.

Java's goal, as a member of the dark cult around the entity, is to create a nuclear bomb and detonate it within the castle at the top of Mont de Pierre. He wants to do this as the rock the city sits on is actually an egg, of sorts. It's the primordial form of a entity-designed killing machine from one of the last cycles of conquest, which is effectively a Turask. If he is successful in this, the Turask will hatch and begin devastating the landscape, guided by ancient instructions and without any effective contemporary control. Java will think he can guide it but he cannot, and this action will not bring the entity's attention back to this world.

Additionally, the Turask will be infused with radioactive energy, which in addition to the effects of the bomb blast will start poisoning the region. Travel will become more difficult. The Turask will terrorize the landscape but without intervention will not move beyond the region's borders.

If Java is able to convince the players to go to his lab, which is an abandoned tower on a rock island in the sea, they'll see the prototype nuclear weapon which he is building there, along with a arcanic one-use portal spell to teleport the device. Java will try to get Kadek to the island regardless of the player's support, so that he can be made to perform final construction of the device and the construciton of the portal spell

If the players go to Kunstlerkollectiv instead, they will have to fight Java first to keep Kadek with them. Once at the Kunstlerkollective, they'll see more stuff. This probably will be next session, but maybe not.
