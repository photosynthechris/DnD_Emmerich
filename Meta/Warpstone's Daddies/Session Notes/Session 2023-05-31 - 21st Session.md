Party returns to the bar, it is about midday.

Eggs says:

What can be measured but not seen?
What has to be broken before you can use it?
I reflect the light, that’s not very bright. I sit in the same place all year, all the time. Right here, you cannot see me all right. At least when it’s not night.
