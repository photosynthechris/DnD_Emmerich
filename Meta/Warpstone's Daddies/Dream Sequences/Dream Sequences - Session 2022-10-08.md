# Dream Sequences
## For Session 2022-10-08
___
### Grogg
___
At first, Grogg falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, as if carried along the wind into the infinite abyss of night. To him, perception and awareness do not exist, time does not exist, all that exists is the void. Then, as quiet as a whisper but so isolated as to fill Grogg's consciousness, Grogg hears a voice. It's a familiar voice, soft but gruff, loving but strong, and while her words are indistinguishable Grogg knows precisely who's speaking: It is the voice of Grogg's mother. Singing him the lullabies of the old orcs, lost beyond the furthest memory. It's a quiet sad song, a song of mourning and loss, and yet filled with hope and optimism. Eventually, the words clear in Grogg's awareness, and he hears:

>Fear not, my child, for hope is alive
>Through struggle, pain, conflict, and strife
>Let not slip from your mind that holy host
>The land of plenty, our ancestral home
>That from which it all began.
>Fear not, my child, for one day yet
>We'll return to the land of the orange sky
>Where the heat of Tor is but a ghost
>And the light of Sol dwindles in your eyes.
>We'll return to where it all began.

And her final breath drifts, like her soul, off into the great abyss, and Grogg once again slips into a deep, dreamless sleep.

### Poogey
___
Poogey awakens, heart pounding and with short breath, to see the party surrounding him in a deep slumber. The fire has long since burned out. The woods are silent, beyond the quietest night. The moon, and the stars, are absent from his skies, and only his dark vision allows him to see.

Suddenly, he sees a dim orange glow burn from deep into the forest. *Does he move towards the light?*

As Poogey moves towards the light, a fog rolls in. After walking what feels like 50 feet or so, the fog ahead of him begins to clear and reveal a small wooden house, looking clearly out of place in the woods. He recognizes it immediately as his home, where he had settled with his wife shortly after their marriage, and almost three years after he was banished by his clan for studying "forbidden knowledge" of his clan's deepest histories. He could see two figures moving about the cabin. The door is slightly ajar.

Suddenly, he finds himself inside. He remembers this home in it's every detail. The small fireplace they had on the southern wall, the modest collection of books he had gathered on his travels to [[Oakgrove]], their kitchen and dining space on the northern side of the house, and the modest loft where they slept above their small, but cozy, living space. His wife is busy busy over a stew, slow boiling on the wrought iron stove, while Poogey's younger self, Gertrudis, 6 years ago and unmeasurably more innocent than the Poogey of today, sits at their dining table deep in study of a book.

Their life was, for the most part, a good one. Living around [[Jorvik]] but outside of the jurisdictions of the pirates and the nobility had it's perks, and they generally enjoyed the little community of [[Oakgrove]]. It had been a fine, secluded place to settle after their marriage. Due to the nature of their union (after all, who could ever see a tiefling and a high elf wed, let alone the daughter of the [[Fellius Rex|head]] of the [[Phonecian Guard]]), the couple had spent much of their young marriage running and hiding from the elvish patrols from [[Phonecia|Avela's homeland]]. 

The space should have been warm, comfortable, welcoming, and filled with the rich smell of the stew, made from the small garden they maintained. Instead, Poogey feels cold, smells nothing, and his heart contains nothing but the deepest, darkest sense of foreboding, and dread.

Avela, your wife, calls to your younger self from the kitchen:

Avela: "Gerty, dearest, no books on the table. Supper's ready. Come get yourself some stew."

Gertrudis: "Ah, just a moment Poogey..."

Clearly drifting off into the book again, Avela walks softly over to her husband, rubs his shoulders, and leans in, asking:

Avela: "What is that you're reading anyway?"

Gertrudis: "It's an odd book I picked up last time I travelled to Jorvik, bought it from one of the tradesmen in the harbor. Seems to be a legendary history of some ancient great land, but I can't connect it to any real history I know of. Must be an old myth *of some sort, at this point I doubt it's about any real place at all.*"

**DM NOTE: remove italics when sending the above to Westen, and when westen reaches the point where the italics start interrupt and move onto next part.**

A loud, pounding knock on the door rings through the house. Gertrudis and Avela look to the door surprised. Poogey feels immense dread and terror as he experiences, once again, what is about to happen...

**At this point we'll move into live roleplay a bit**
*For gameplay, at this point Westen will play Gertrudis, his past self, while Poogey, his current self, watches frozen.*

The pounding continues incessantly as Gertrudis rises to answer it. He hastily opens the door to see an imposing high elf of great height, glaring down at him with a glare like hot daggers. He is dressed in well made but plain white robes, tightly buttoned around his neck, and surrounded at his left and right by two armored figures, faces obscured by closed face shields.

The elf speaks with a voice like a hammer hitting an anvil,

"Gertrudis Kral of the demon clan Kouzelnik, you are hereby under arrest for the crime of kidnapping, grave insult of a noble family, desertion of your parole, heresy, and betrayal to the state. You will be escorted to Phonetix where, by rite of the Great Pillars and with the gods and your victims as witness, you will be put to death by method of immolation."

*Then a fight sequence begins, which eventually will end in the accidental death of Poogey's wife, whatever happens after is up to Westen, he could be captured, he could escape, but the dream will end shortly after.*

And in that moment, Gertrudis looks up, and Poogey looks on, and sees the dagger now piercing his wife's heart, blood beginning to pour from her chest. What happens after is largely lost to him, all he remembers is the scream that escaped him as rage overtook him. And before he knew it, the three paladins collapsed to the floor dismembered and mutilated, and a great and sudden wind blowing through the house extinguishes every source of illumination, except for a deep purple glow emanating from within Gertrudis's chest. As the light fades, he runs and drops to his wife and attempts to use whatever little healing magic he knows on her, but to no avail. As she grows cold, and her breaths grow faint, she whispers some words to Gertrudis that he cannot hear. He leans closer, and Avela says:

"Don't blame yourself, I will always... love... you..."

In the last moments of the dream, as the pain of it all starts to overwhelm Poogey's senses, the book again comes to his mind. All other details have long been lost to his memory, except for the last few lines he had read:

*Have Westen read:*

>Your pride has deceived you
>you who think you live above the coming storm,
>you say in your heart,
>"Who could bring me down to the ground?"
>Though you soar aloft like the eagle,
>though your nest is set amongst the stars,
>from there *I* will bring you down.

### Essek
___

Essek becomes aware of a brilliantly soft silvery light. He opens his eyes to see a smooth white sphere, the whole moon, silhouetted by a female figure with long, nebulous hair, arms outstretched, dress flowing gently in the wind. He cannot see her face, nor can he move. She begins to speak, but not by voice. Essek perceives her as saying:

>What do you know of the world on which you live?
>If you can hardly understand your own mind
>your own past, your own life, that which is locked within.
>Look up, Essek, look up towards the stars,
>distant suns, unknown and forgotten worlds,
>can't you see how wrong they are?
>Where is tranquility, serenity, crisis or storms,
>Tycho, Plato, Imbrium, or Copernicus?
>You are a being long lost, cast out from their homeland,
>will you ever find your way back if you cannot remember?
>You must find your way, find your way back into the whole moon's light
>And you must not forget, never forget, that from which you came.
>4 0 5 1 9 9 3

### Kelda
___

Kelda slowly drifts into awareness, gently rustling leaves, bubbling streams, the soft incessant call of frogs, crickets, cicadas, the sounds of the sleeping jungle gently drifting on the wind. She becomes aware of the shape of the jungle, it's extents over the land, the way the trees pebble across the landscape. She can feel the jungle's infinitely complex root system buzzing with activity, 100 billion trees communing, contemplating, conversing, dreaming.

Suddenly, she is aware of a presence, an awareness in the buzz of thought, slowly forming from uncountable numbers of mycelial and biological reactions. It's a presence Kelda knows well.

The forest begins to rise from it's roots almost like a great velvet robe on the back of a sleeping giant. Trees, lakes, rivers, and swamps all flow from the figure as it rises, comes to it's feet, 

*This will include a commune with the forest spirit, the embodiment of the lustrine swamps. Ideally, this may help introduce the players to the idea of entities as embodiments of physical places.*

___
### Tali
___



*Talk to Hales about her thoughts, but I'm thinking this will be a vague memory from her deep past, or more likely a vision of something happening elsewhere, possibly as part of her mushroom exposure*
