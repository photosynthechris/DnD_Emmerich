___
### Grogg
___
At first, Grogg falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, as if carried along the wind into the infinite abyss of night. To him, perception and awareness do not exist, time does not exist, all that exists is the void. Then, as quiet as a whisper but so isolated as to fill Grogg's consciousness, Grogg hears a voice. It's a familiar voice, soft but gruff, loving but strong, and while her words are indistinguishable Grogg knows precisely who's speaking: It is the voice of Grogg's mother. Singing him the lullabies of the old orcs, lost beyond the furthest memory. It's a quiet sad song, a song of mourning and loss, and yet filled with hope and optimism. Eventually, the words clear in Grogg's awareness, and he hears:

>Fear not, my child, for hope is alive
>Through struggle, pain, conflict, and strife
>Let not slip from your mind that holy host
>The land of plenty, our ancestral home
>That from which it all began.
>Fear not, my child, for one day yet
>We'll return to the land of the orange sky
>Where the heat of Tor is but a ghost
>And the light of Sol is dwindles in your eyes.
>We'll return to where it all began.

And her final breath drifts, like her soul, off into the great abyss, and Grogg once again slips into a deep, dreamless sleep.

### Poogey
___
Poogey awakens, heart pounding and with short breath, to see the party surrounding him in a deep slumber. The fire has long since burned out. The woods are silent, beyond the quietest night. The moon, and the stars, are absent from his skies, and only his dark vision allows him to see.

Suddenly, he sees a dim orange glow burn from deep into the forest. *Does he move towards the light?*

As Poogey moves towards the light, a fog rolls in. After walking what feels like 50 feet or so, the fog ahead of him begins to clear and reveal a small wooden house, looking clearly out of place in the woods. He recognizes it immediately as his home, where he had settled with his wife shortly after their marriage, and almost three years after he was banished by his clan for studying "forbidden knowledge" of his clan's deepest histories. He could see two figures moving about the cabin. The door is slightly ajar. *Does he go inside?*

#### IF YES:

Poogey enters the cabin, to see himself, 5 years younger and unmeasurably more innocent than the Poogey of today, assisting his wife in the preparation of their supper stew.

Avela: "Gertrudis, dear, you've been slaving over that book for hours now, you're going to strain your eyes. Come have some stew, would you?"

Poogey: "I'll be that way in just a second darling"
