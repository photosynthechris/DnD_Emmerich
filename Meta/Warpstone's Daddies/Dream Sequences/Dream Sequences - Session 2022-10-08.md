### Grogg
___
At first, Grogg falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, as if carried along the wind into the infinite abyss of night. To him, perception and awareness do not exist, time does not exist, all that exists is the void. Then, as quiet as a whisper but so isolated as to fill Grogg's consciousness, Grogg hears a voice. It's a familiar voice, soft but gruff, loving but strong, and while her words are indistinguishable Grogg knows precisely who's speaking: It is the voice of Grogg's mother. Singing him the lullabies of the old orcs, lost beyond the furthest memory. It's a quiet sad song, a song of mourning and loss, and yet filled with hope and optimism. Eventually, the words clear in Grogg's awareness, and he hears:

>Fear not, my child, for hope is not lost
>Through struggle, pain, conflict, and strife
>Let not slip from your mind that holy host
>The land of plenty, our ancestral home
>That from which it all began.
