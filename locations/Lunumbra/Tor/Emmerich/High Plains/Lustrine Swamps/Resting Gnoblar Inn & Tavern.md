A kindly tavern filled with lively folk, mostly the upper common of the city and the slightly more well off. Even in a land of crime and shit there’s still a place where good folk come together, even if they are standoffish and slow to trust.

The characters may even discover whiffs of a rebellion, which Bula is secretly organizing.

The bartender is an imposing orc woman named “Bula.” If the party mentions the slavers outside the city she’ll acknowledge that she knows them, Ungar is a piece of shit that ought to burn in Hades, and the party was lucky getting away like they did. Though, she adds under her breath, he’s too stupid to have much of a thought in the first place.
