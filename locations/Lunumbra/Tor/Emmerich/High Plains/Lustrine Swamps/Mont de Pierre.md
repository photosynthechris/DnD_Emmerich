# Mont de Pierre
*This is a starting quote for the article.*
___

Mont de Pierre is a small decayed city on the northern coast of the continent of [[Emmerich]]. It is the seat of the [[High Plains]] region of the continent. Owing to it's position on the shore of the [[Great Northern Ocean]], alongside the [[Skyway River]], and at the intersection of the [[Intercontinental Highway of Emmerich]] and [[Raul's Route]], the city has historically been a major center of commerce, travel, and scholarship. The city is built atop the [[Rock of Luster]], a large chunk of limestone and granite deposit ejected from Emmerich's western shores during the [[Last Uprising]].

## History

The city was founded several thousand years ago out of an alliance of several disparate villages in the [[Lustrine Swamps]]. Starting as simple wooden settlements around the base of the Rock of Luster, the city eventually expanded up, over, and into the Rock itself. At it's most recent height, the city was a member of the [[Continental Republic]], and supported a robust population of 300,000 people. At this time, the city was governed by the [[Council of the Mont]], a meritocritus council of the city's premiere Guild-masters, scholars, merchant men, and multiple citizen's represenatatives.

Since the [[Fall of the Republic]], Mont de Pierre has declined dramatically. Many were killed in the ecological disaster that followed the [[Concentrate Bomb#Detonation|Great Flash]], and many more fled in the societal collapse that followed. The Council was granted emergency powers two months into the Fall, allowing the power of the draft, confiscation of resources "deemed necessary to save the city", and suspension of [[Council of the Mont#Procedures|Council Procedures]]. This, combined with an increasingly mercantile focus of the council in the years preceeding, led to the informal establishment of the [[Leebeltar]] system of government.

Civil liberties and general conditions in the city continued to degrade in the following years. The newly empowered council claimed a modest domain of full control over the Swamps and several surrounding villages and any trade caravans operating in the area. Regulations on construction, employement, and quality of living were removed and modified to fill the purposes of the Council. [[The Constibulary of the Continental Republic#High Plains Office|The Constibulary of the Plains]] was dissolved, as were lingering regulatory offices, leading to increasing corruption in the local economy and political establishment. This culminated in the reinstatement of slavery 200 years before game start. This final decision lead to the [[Summer Massacre of 213|Serf's Rebellion]] in 213, during which mercenary forces hired by the city slaughtered over 1,000 citizens protesting the new laws and the direction the city had taken.

Following the rebellion, many remaining citizens of the city fled, either beyond the Swamps, by sea, or into the [[Mont de Pierre#Unttermont|under city]]. Each option, while dangerous, compared favorably to the declining conditions in the city. As slavers started operations, and protections for regular citizens diminished, many of the city's more downtrodden residents were captured and enslaved. In addition to this, infighting between the members of the council grew and grew. This culminated in the [[July Duel of 237]], when the Council's chairperson was challenged for their position by the Slaversguild-master. The Guild-master won, and claimed the chair for himself. This rendered the Council abolished, effectively, as the last of the old rules had been replaced by the mindless dueling of the "warlords"

Today, the city is a ruined shadow of it's former self, barely a city at all. Much of the city's outer reaches is entirely abandoned, slowly being reconsumed by the swamp. The city's inner quarters are filled with slave markets, thieves, broken communities, and dark taverns. The [[Chataeu de Pierre]], the seat of the Council's former power, stands darkened with soot and malace, overlooking the ruin of the Mont.

Much of the city's remaining original population lives either in fortified pockets in the middle sections of the city, or in forgotten rooms in the undercity, while the city's merchants, slavers, and craftspeople live in the more intact upper city surrounding the Chataeu.

## Sections of the City

### Unttermont
---
The Unttermont are the city's basements, sewers, catacombs, and other forgotten structures carved deep into the Rock. The Unttermont is most easily navigated using the different layers, although these layers are not constant throughout the city.

#### Chataeu Sousol

The highest layer of the Unttermont, the Chataeu Sousol is composed of the various underground facilities immediately connected to the Chataeu itself.

#### Chataeu Catacombs

Beneath the [[Mont de Pierre#Chataeu Sousol|Sousol]] are the Catacombs. These are the top of the city's vast catacomb network. In ages past, the most honored of the city's citizens would've been memorialized here. In the present day, the catacombs are abandoned to all mortals with any sense at all.

#### City Sewers and Serviceways

Most of the city built upon the Rock is connected by a labrynthine network of sewers and serviceways, which once provided the luxurious ammenities of running water, sewage, heating and Astralights to many of the city's buildings. As part of this network, a number of serviceways and stations were built, tunnels and large chambers where the city servantry could work, rest, and feast during their shifts under the city. Today, these are primarily occupied by the free peoples of the city, many of the city's original inhabitants seeking refuge from the corruption above.

#### Commentry Catacomb

The Catacombs permeate all, and are woven throughout the city's sewers, serviceways, and other unttermont structures. Nobody knows how far down they go, but thousands of years of graves, secret shrines, scattered memorials have left their mark. It would be foolish to venture too far down here...

### Lower City

In the modern day, much of the lower city is abandoned and ruined. While a wall once ran around the entire length of the city's perimeter, made by mined rock from within the Mont, nowadays much of this wall is decayed and collapsed into the swamp. In the worst hit areas, the swamp is slowly creeping back into the city itself, bringing murky water, vegetation, and all manner of swamp creature with it.

Beyond that, one may also find pockets of mortal souls. Anyone who choses to live here does so only out of necessity, as such these pockets are only composed of rebels, downtrodden vagrants, cultists, and thieves.

#### Southern Gate

The most used gate. This gate once beaconed travelers into the city with it's regal beauty, a work of art commissioned by the Council involving many of the city's trade guilds. It was the pride of the city. Now it is hardly a gate at all. The surrounding area is largely abandoned, save those traveling through the gate and those looking to steal from them.

#### Western Gate

The most intact of the gates. This gate has for ages and continues to welcome travellers from the mountain homes of the western [[Grouschold Range]]. Beyond the road into the city, there are several Dwarven and other trading stations, refugee populations, and a rebel stronghold.

Locations of Interest Include:
 - [[Temple of Eilistrae]]

#### Eastern Gate

The least intact and least used of the gates. This gate once welcomed travellers from the highway from Jorvik and the lands of the East. It was refurbished during the time of the Republic to interface with the new autocarriage network established by the Republic, and some of that infrastructure remains to this day. However, much of this area of the city has sunk into the swamp, and vegetation cloggs it's streets. Only the dreggs of society live here, and the monsters of the swamp.

#### Northern Harbor



### Middle City

The lower parts of the city built upon the Rock itself. The middle city houses some of the city's original population, but is mostly characterized by it's connections to the [[Mont de Pierre#Unttermont#City Sewers and Serviceways|Serviceways]]. The pockets of population that live in the Middle City are mostly surface protrusions of society in the Serviceways. Many rebel sympathizing civilians live here, though rebels themselves avoid it due to proximity to the [[Mont de Pierre#Upper City|Upper City]] and the Chair's mercenary patrols.

Locations of Interest Include:

 - [[Grossmarch Tavern]]
 - [[Winstel's Market]]
 - [[Citizen's Library]]

### Upper City

The Upper City, once the pride of Mont de Pierre, now mostly contains gangs, slavers, and their ilk. While technically the best maintained part of the city, it's the most dangerous area for the regular traveller.

Locations of Interest Include:

 - [[Chataeu de Pierre]]
 - [[The Gulch]]
 - [[Steenschlass]]
 - [[Hangman's Market]]
