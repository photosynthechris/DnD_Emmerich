Caravans come out, peddling crafted goods, slaves, and stuff they gather in the underdark

[[Temple of Eilistrae]]



??? Possible historical name, Eiliut?
What if the city was named after a historical figure who was involved in finding the mysterious construction and, in legends, built the city herself.
This mysterious hooded woman, almost a shadow within the legends, became the original mythos of the goddess Eilistrae

Eilistrae was the daughter of Lolth in D&D lore, who sought to free drow from the dark clutches of her mother in the underdark. So why would a temple dedicated to her chose to set up shop in this place?

I don't think it makes that much sense to connect the goddess lore to this city, unless the city is truly ancient

What about this



In the modern world, there are many races that exist across [[Tor]], but this has not always been so. Several ages past, many tens of thousands of years ago, times were much simpler. There only existed a scant few humanoid races: Dwarves, Humans, and halflings, though the difference between each was not so drastic as it is now. Dwarves were the descendants of humans from ages prior to even this ancient time who spent countless millennia living generation after generation beneath the old mountains and hillocks of the world. Halflings, while famous for keeping detailed accounts of their family lineages, rarely took into account the geography of the lands they inhabited, so exactly where they come from was lost even in this time.

But, and this may surprise the reader, the world of [[Tor]] had never heard of an elf. Or a drow for that matter.

No, but there were stories scattered across time. For about 2000 years (?) before this present, there were occasional, peculiar stories of tall, skinny humans in glittering armor peppered across much of the world. There is even a tale or two of the creatures "appearing as if from thin air" through doorways of light.

As has happened for many ages, the people of [[Tor]] were on yet another rise on the cycle of rise and fall, and had been for most of the 2000 years these "mysterious visits" took place.

This age was a particularly climactically difficult one (for why?), and so the surface societies of the time were forced to adapt to sheltered living.

Unsurprisingly, this was a golden age for the dwarves, specialized as they were to living in the deep underdark. Beyond that, however, they benefited greatly from the newfound reliance the surface civilizations of men, halflings, and even hill dwarves had upon them, and many dwarven leaders became greedy on their newfound wealth and power.

The most powerful dwarven civilizations (who?) began delving greedily and deeply, both into their effective subjugation of surface society, and literally into the deep parts of the earth, deep underneath the eastern and western mountains of [[Emmerich]]

On the surface, the major dwarven mountainhomes soon developed a feudal society centered on their primary fortresses, which developed growing networks of vassals over the middle period of this age. Complex inter-realm interactions began as centuries of feudal politics set hold on most of the mountainous and adjacent areas of Emmerich.

Underground, the dug deeper and deeper into the crust, and explored caverns and buried ruins that should have been left forgotten. It was one of these dwarven fiefs that unearthed [[The Entity]] during this age, and formed this age's eneity cult (specify)

What none of the dwarf lords realized, buried in the ground as they were, was that the climate on the surface was slowly, finally, stabilizing. Chaotic storm systems, devastating storm and tidal surges, lethal extreme temperature events, and withering droughts, all slowly faded in the last half milennia of this age.

This was partially natural, as the affects of anthropogenic climate change from ages prior began to finally fade away. It was also partially added by the mysterious guests, the elves.

The elves were descendants of the original human settlers of Mars, who had become well enough established in the first age before the destruction of the Moon to survive being cut off from Earth. Over many tens of thousands of years, they managed to build a complex society and transform Mars into the world that it is today.

The first Martian colonies were a century long development of international space programs in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries. An underground, radiation protected settlement network covered many of the more hospitable parts of the red planet, while a robust network of satellite communications, weather monitoring, space manufacturing and launch infrastructure, and centripetal force artificial gravity habitats dotted the skies above. A few cities existed under domes which served as transport hubs between space infrastructure overhead and the underground settlements that surrounded them.

When contact with Earth was lost, this left Mars in a very interesting place.

They could either die going back to or on Earth, which was a radioactive, possibly supernatural hell hole at this point, or die on Mars. Most chose the latter.

The Martians tried to make it work. Things were extremely difficult for the first few centuries. In this early time, a distinct cultural division formed between the different components of Martian society. Those that lived in orbit and drove the development of the habitation project, i.e. the 'terraforming' of Mars, could be called the ecologists (what kinda name fits here?). Those that lived in the domed cities (but to be clear, mostly the ones of some status, i.e. petite bourgeois and above) where something of the aristocracy of the world, mostly due to their status as the middle-men between the majority of the population and the space infrastructure above, both of which relied on the other (while the aristocracy relied on both). Finally, the majority of the population, those who lived in the burrowed settlements that soon spread across most of the world, would get a pejorative nickname from the aristocracy of the domes that would stick throughout the ages to this very day: the drow.
