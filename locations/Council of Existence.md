# Council of Existence
![[seat-of-god-header.jpg]]

>*It be the will of our world. It be the will of us all.*

Uncountable ages before the Earth was created, across the infinite chasm of space, the Council of Existence always stood. From the very beginning, the looming maw of the [[Lunumbra (Location)|Universe's]] hoizon hangs low above the planet's darkened surface.

The Council of Existence was created shortly after the birth of the Universe by the combined spirits of the Universe itself. It serves as a contact point between the Universe as an entity, and the "contents" therein. In one sense, the Council of Existence hosts all the disparate spirits of the Universe, an infinite chamber of reflection and perspective. On the other, it houses only one entity, the Universe itself, and it's focus.

The Council of Existence can be physically accessed using a powerful enough [[Spatial Gate]], however the connection is often unstable due to the will of the Universe itself. Players may have to convince [[Lunumbra (Entity)|Lunumbra]], or gain some other form of insight, to pass safely. Some have even been brought to this place by the Universe, typically in a dream or some other intangible form.
