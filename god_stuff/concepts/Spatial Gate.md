# Spatial Gate
![[mw_portal_room.png]]

The Spatial Gate is an extremely advanced arcane technology, near the apex of the [[Physical Plane|physical realm's]] technological achievements. Put simply, it is a device which can tune to and create a physical connection between two points in space. To do this, it integrates all three physical energies, each of which is immensely important to the proper operation of the portal.
