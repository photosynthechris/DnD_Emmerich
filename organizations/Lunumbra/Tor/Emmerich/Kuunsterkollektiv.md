# Kuunstlerkollektiv
*Wizard's College of the [[High Plains]]*
___

A dark and shrouded school of magics and wizardry. This school sits at the base of one of the highest peaks of the [[Grouschold Range]], secluded deep in the wilderness. There has been little contact with the school since the [[Fall of the Republic]], beyond the occasional traveler in and out, none know much about the mysterious workings going on inside. What nobody knows, is the Kuunstlerkollektiv is the secret home of [[Kadek Warpstone]], the mad sorcerer, master of space itself, who is dutifully working on a new, controllable gate so he and his army of wizards can meet the threat of the [[The Entity|Shattered Moon]], and end it once and for all. He is a long way away from this goal, not the least of hurdles being the school’s ancient reactor is dead without a viable source of radioactive energy. With the energy from the [[Plutonium Sphere|sphere]], the school could once again power all it’s arcane mechanisms, which include continental divination, arcane communication, and one-way travel through an [[Spatial Gate|ancient, unstable gate]] located deep within the school.
