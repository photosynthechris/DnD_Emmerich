*The Paladin's College of the [[locations/Lunumbra/Tor/Emmerich/High Plains/High Plains]]*
___
The paladin’s college, an iron wrought castle of order and dominance, here is where the world’s crusaders are forged. And yet, despite the purity of it’s vision, the castle has fallen into corruption and ruin. Nowadays the college is little more than a merc’s training grounds. It’s administration is rich and rotten to it’s core, happily collecting the profits of all manner of deviancy and crime, from slavery to extortion.

Corrupted by the [[Leebeltar]] shift.
