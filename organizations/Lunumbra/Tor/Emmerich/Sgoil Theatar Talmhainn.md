The bard’s college, a place of great arts and literature, the music and songs of the distant ages, held within the vice grip of academic snobbery and the compulsive need for artistic purity. The bard’s college as it currently stands is a shadow of it’s ancient self, when prolific artists and musicians, playwrights and actors crowded it’s stages, experimenting at the forefront of artistic expression. Nowadays, the college is little more than a bloated library. Work is strictly controlled, it’s faculty so obsessed with the “correct” display, performance, or usage of the work that even reading or seeing work is barred behind a closely guarded and curated admissions process.
