# Raven's Shield Institution of Arcana and Natural Sciences
*A traditional institution of applied magics and natural philosophy*
___
One of the more grounded of the different colleges of the [[locations/Lunumbra/Tor/Emmerich/High Plains/High Plains]], Ravenshield is dedicated to exploring the natural sciences, how the physical world interacts with magic and vice versa. More broadly, they study engineering and arcana, history, and “Logics”, mostly meaning maths. They are lead by a committee of 7 which decide on most matters to do with the college, from admission of new students to macro organization decisions. The committee is composed of the 7 academic department heads, with a rotating chairmanship. Largely unknown to the department heads, deep and extensive catacombs exist that dive way way under the college, through many layers of archaeology and history. At the very very very bottom of these catacombs, even deeper than the school’s connection to the underdark, is the buried remains of an ancient computer facility, inside containing a computer of great knowledge and wisdom.
