The Lib movement is the short name for the revolt brewing in the city amongst the common folk. It’s a complicated, very loosely defined group. Some amongst their member are city folk who’ve stuck out the bad times, desperate for a change back to peace and order in the Mont. Others are rebels, looking to bust the ass of those in power. And some came from outside, or were supported by outside groups, with the goal to remove the current rotating anarchic regime and establish power in the area.

Internally, the following factions hold the most sway:

The Raatiners are the largest, and most ideologically loose, of the internal factions in the Lib movement. It primarily acts for the general purpose of deposing the current anarchist governance and reestablishing a community council for the city. As this goal can coincide with others, most members of the Lib movement are also a Raatiner, even if they are part of another faction.

The Kaufites are the next largest, but a fairly diverse group on their own. They compose of merchants who generally believe that the merchant guilds of the city should serve as the basis of the new government. The more liberal end of this group are essentially an offshoot of the Raatiners, individuals who believe anything from guild representation on the council, to the guilds acting as an acting government or supporting the new government in getting established. The more extreme are the radical Kaufites, who believe that a strong private guildship council of the most prominent property owners is the only real way to rebuild the city.

On the other end of the spectrum we have the Vertenists, mostly formed from the city’s enslaved and subservient population and their academic allies, advocate for popular ownership of the city’s redevelopment efforts, and the future government. They are generally opposed to the Kaufites and radically opposed to the racial factions.

The last group, more scattered among the rest, are the racial factions. Those individuals that, for various reasons, blame particular or a group of races for the problems in the city, and think some form of “dealing with” their race of choice will help resolve those problems. These sentiments are not as strong as others at present.

In addition to these, there are external factions lobbying to control the movement:

First, we have the Council of Academics, and through them the Cult of Law, attempting to aid the Raatiners, specifically in the creation of a strong, lawful system of government. Depending on the particular college/character in question, the Council may express support for a combination with Kaufites (Cult of Neutrality), Vertenists (Cult of Good), or racial interests (Cult of Evil).

Second, we have the mercenary bands, foreign merchants, and their associated organizations/guilds. Depending on the guild in question, these may support the Kaufites (or radical Kaufites), fight the Vertenists, support the racial factions, or support the current form of government.

Third, we have the drow lords in the underdark, who are in a deal with the current government and connected to parts of the criminal structure of the Mont. They mostly care to keep making money, so at game start may be persuaded to shift alligences in the right circumstances. However, in the long term, they dream of establishing a colony of sorts, but can’t establish the internal unity to accomplish that. If those circumstances change, the story may be different.
