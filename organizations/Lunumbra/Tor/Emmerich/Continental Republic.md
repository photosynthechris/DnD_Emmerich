# Continental Republic
*This is a starting quote for the article.*
___

The **Continental Republic** was a federal organization of city-states and state-like entities organized in the [[8th Era#Eighteenth Century|18th century of the Era of Revivals]] on the continent of [[Emmerich]]. Notable in [[Tor|Tor's]] history for reviving ancient ideas of democracy and representative collective government on the continent, the so-called *Free People's Alliance* was created primarily to counter the growing threat of the revived [[The Entity|Entity of the West]] and establish continental order and peace.

The Republic was initially successful in these aims. After the apparent defeat of the Entity at the legendary [[Battle of Two Songs]] in the summer of [[8th Era#Nineteenth Century|8E:1851]], Republican attention turned to increasing quality of life and general development on the continent. By the beginning of the [[Fall of the Republic|Time of Troubles]], Alliance cities enjoyed public electricity and lighting, running water and sewage, mass communication, and rapid transit. Continental projects, such as the [[Intercontinental Highway of Emmerich]], gave hundreds of thousands of residents the means to visit the continent's great cities and connected communities in a way that hadn't been seen for many many years.

By [[8th Era#Twentieth Century|8E:1947]] it became undeniable that the Entity had not perished in the Two Songs as was widely believed, but had in fact continued to grow in strength through the [[Entity's Will|Mold]] it propagated through the continent's poorly connected underdark, and the Republic's growing [[Electro-Magical Theory|electro-magical energy networks]]. Work began on the [[Concentrate Bomb]] soon after, aided by the discovery of [[Entity's Will#Crystals|Entity derived crystals]] found in the deep caves under the western mountains.

At the same time, growing strife and disagreements between the member cities led to significant political gridlock in the [[Continental Senate]] immediately after the re-discovery of the Entity. This, in addition to the [[Concentrate Bomb#Detonation|Great Flash]] and the ecological consequences that unfolded afterwards, led to a final collapse of the Continental Republic on [[9th Era#First Century|9E:3]].

By the [[9th Era#Fourth Century|fourth century of the ninth era]] the Republic has completely slipped from memory in many parts of the continent. Many of the organization's structures remain to some extent or another, and some cities and settlements retain the iconography and symbolism of the organization, but the organization as an entity is completely lost to time.
