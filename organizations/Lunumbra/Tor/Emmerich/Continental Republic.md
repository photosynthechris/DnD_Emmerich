# Continental Republic
*This is a starting quote for the article.*
___

The **Continental Republic** was a federal organization of city-states and state-like entities organized in the [[8th Era#Eighteenth Century|18th century of the Era of Revivals]] on the continent of [[Emmerich]]. Notable in [[Tor|Tor's]] history for reviving ancient ideas of democracy and representative collective government on the continent, the so-called *Free People's Alliance* was created primarily to counter the growing threat of the revived [[The Entity|Entity of the West]] and establish continental order and peace.

The Republic was initially successful in these aims. After the apparent defeat of the Entity at the legendary [[Battle of Two Songs]] in the summer of [[8th Era#Nineteenth Century|8E:1851]], Republican attention turned to increasing quality of life and general development on the continent. By the beginning of the [[Fall of the Republic|Time of Troubles]], Alliance cities enjoyed public electricity and lighting, running water and sewage, mass communication, and rapid transit. Continental projects, such as the [[Intercontinental Highway of Emmerich]], gave hundreds of thousands of residents the means to visit the continent's great cities and connected communities in a way that hadn't been seen for many many years.
