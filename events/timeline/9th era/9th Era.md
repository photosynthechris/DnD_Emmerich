# 9th Era
*A new age, clouded in shadow. An old world, lost in the mists. As in the last moments of the night before the break of day.*
___

The 9th Era is the current era of history on [[Tor]]. It is only 437 years old. The 9th age thus far has been primarily notable for it's decline of civilized governments, dissolution of organized society, and general struggle and strife in [[Emmerich]], largely caused by the cataclysmic [[Concentrate Bomb#Detonation|Great Flash]] which concluded the [[8th Era]] and began this one.
