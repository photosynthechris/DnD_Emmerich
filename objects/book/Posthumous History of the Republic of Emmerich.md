## Final Collapse
Detionation of the "Concentrate Bomb" (or the Crystal Bomb), created by rep scientiests succeeded in it's goal to neutralize the entity of the west. However, this created a continent (and possibly planet) spanning magically charged storm called the "Purple Storms", which fried electro-magical technology, distrupted supply and communication across the continent, and caused major tidal waves around the continent. The combined stressors led to the collapse of the continental republic.
